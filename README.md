A Geometry Dash mod that allows to play levels from GDPS Editor 2.2 (private server that was shut down in april 2023)

Most of the code is from [here](https://github.com/SergeyMC9730/levelhistory), i've just made functions to download levels from archive.org



# Installation

To download, chick on `1 tags` in releases tab. 

After downloading the corrent version, open Geometry Dash -> Geode logo -> button with folder on it.

Drag the downloaded file in the opened folder, reload GD and play!




### My todo list
- rewrite everything (add fancy search ui)
- add automatic level fixing (some blocks are broken, most platformer levels are unplayable)
