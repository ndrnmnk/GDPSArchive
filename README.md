A Geometry Dash mod that allows to play levels from GDPS Editor 2.2 (private server that was shut down in april 2023)

Most of the code is from [here](https://github.com/SergeyMC9730/levelhistory), i've just made functions to download levels from archive.org

Todo:
- rewrite everything (add fancy search ui)
- add automatic level fixing (some blocks are broken, most platformer levels are unplayable)
